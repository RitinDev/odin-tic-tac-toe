# odin-tic-tac-toe
The Odin Project: Projects - Tic Tac Toe

Learning Outcomes:  
1. Learn how to show certain parts of a website (in this case, play either against player or against CPU) based on the selection choice of a `select` form / button
2. Learn how to work with factory functions and IIFE-based modules to tuck all attributes and methods related to something in one place, away from the global scope
   * Factory functions: Used for things that need to be produced multiple times, such as players
   * IIFE-based modules: Used for things that only need to be produced once, such as the gameboard and the game itself
3. Revisit playing turn-based games with simple `addEventListener()` and `removeEventListener()`, similar to rock-paper-scissors.
4. Learn how to integrate a CPU into turn-based games in vanilla JS
5. Learn more about creating and merging branches (especially for big changes) into `main`
